Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

Technology Purpose

HTML5 Structures the game board and interface elements.

CSS3 Styles the visual appearance, ensuring a modern and responsive look.

JavaScript (ES6+)Manages all the game logic, interactivity, and DOM manipulation.

Note: Vanilla JS is a term used to refer to plain JavaScript without any additional libraries or frameworks (like React, Angular, jQuery, etc.).

Essentially, it means writing code using only the standard, built-in features and APIs provided by the JavaScript language itself, as defined by the ECMAScript specification and implemented by web browsers.

It's not a framework or a library. It's simply the core JavaScript language.

Using Vanilla JS means manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) directly, handling events, and making network requests (e.g., using fetch()) without the abstraction layers provided by third-party tools.

In short: Vanilla JS = JavaScript.
